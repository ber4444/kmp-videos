# Inner Circle Squared

A Compose Multiplatform (Android + iOS + wasmJs) app for streaming live and
recorded HLS event streams, built on **Media3/ExoPlayer** (Android) and
**AVPlayer** (iOS) with a standalone KMP playback SDK (`:mediakit`).

**Live on Google Play:**
[com.livingpresence.inner.circle.squared](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.livingpresence.inner.circle.squared)

It plays live/recorded HLS event streams from a Wowza nDVR server and turns four
*unadvertised* sibling renditions into a genuine client-side ABR ladder.

> 📐 The full design — ground-truth server measurements and the rationale
> behind each decision — lives in [`plan.md`](./plan.md).

## Features

- **Adaptive streaming.** Genuine client-side ABR synthesized from four
  unadvertised sibling renditions, with viewport-aware track selection so the
  chosen quality matches the surface size.
- **Live & recorded playback.** Live-vs-VOD is inferred from playlist inspection;
  live events expose a LIVE badge and jump-to-live, and the seek bar tracks a
  growing Wowza nDVR window without drift.
- **Thumbnail feed with scrub preview.** Poster tiles and a scrub-preview bubble 
  are powered by an ExoPlayer frame engine on Android, and native `AVAssetImageGenerator` 
  on iOS, avoiding the overhead of N full per-tile players.
- **Flexible presentation.** fit/fill/zoom resize matrix for both horizontal and
  vertical (9:16) video, rotate-to-fullscreen, auto-hiding controls,
  buffering/error UX, and a stats overlay + quality menu.
- **Background & Picture-in-Picture.** Playback is owned by a `MediaSession`
  service (surviving config changes), with PiP aspect-clamped for vertical video
  and background audio constrained to the low-bitrate audio-only tier.
- **Offline downloads.** Bounded (VOD) events download via WorkManager (Android) 
  and `AVAssetDownloadURLSession` (iOS) into a cache shared with playback; 
  truly-live events get no download affordance.
- **Cross-platform Parity.** A seamless unified experience across Android, iOS, and Wasm. 
  The app features native in-app Web navigation, unified UI aesthetics across all targets, 
  hardware-accelerated thumbnail extraction on iOS via `AVAssetImageGenerator`, and robust 
  native iOS background HLS downloading using `AVAssetDownloadURLSession`.

## Architecture

```
:composeApp        — app UI (feed, login, player), navigation, DI wiring
:mediakit          — KMP playback SDK
  commonMain       — PlaylistInspector (pure-Kotlin HLS parser), LadderSynthesizer
                     (multivariant playlist builder), LadderResolver (JIT rendition
                     probing), EventCatalog (parallel event probing), MediaKitConfig,
                     EventInfo/ProbedRendition/RenditionTier models
  androidMain      — ExoPlayer (in PlaybackService), PreviewFrameEngine,
                     DownloadCenter, MemoryGovernor, LadderMediaSourceBuilder
  iosMain          — AVPlayer playback (UIKitView + AVPlayerLayer cinterop),
                     PiP, background audio, native offline downloads
  wasmJsMain       — thin web target (poster tiles + in-app player screen)
```

The playback engine lives in `:mediakit`, **owned by a `MediaSessionService`**,
not by a composable — it survives config changes and enables background
audio/PiP.

- Shared UI and app state live in `composeApp/src/commonMain`
- Shared image resources live in `composeApp/src/commonMain/composeResources`
- Android entry points and playback integration live in `composeApp/src/androidMain`
- iOS entry points and AVPlayer integration live in `composeApp/src/iosMain`
- Web entry points live in `composeApp/src/wasmJsMain`

## Engineering decisions

The load-bearing design calls and the reasoning behind them live in [`plan.md`](./plan.md).

## TODO: deferred from the AGP 9 migration

The supported Gradle 9/AGP 9 migration is planned in
[`plan.md`](./plan.md) under “Standalone PR plan — Gradle 9 and AGP 9
migration.” The migration PR intentionally leaves these follow-ups out:

- [ ] Rename `:composeApp` to `:shared` and extract a separate `:webApp`
  (JetBrains' recommended full platform restructure). The minimum supported
  split keeps iOS and Wasm in `:composeApp`.
- [ ] Revisit the ordinary dependency upgrades grouped into Dependabot PR #33.
  AndroidX, Media3, Ktor, coroutines, Metro, and other runtime updates
  should be reviewed in smaller dependency-only PRs.
- [ ] Extract repeated build configuration into convention plugins after the
  migrated module boundaries have stabilized.
- [ ] Refresh checked-in or developer-local Android Studio run configurations
  to target `:androidApp`; this is IDE metadata, not part of the Gradle
  migration itself.
- [ ] Consider a later full AGP-defaults/R8 audit with release smoke testing.
  The migration adopts defaults needed for AGP 9, but does not redesign keep
  rules, shrinking policy, packaging, or release delivery.

## Building

### Android
```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug            # debug APK → composeApp/build/outputs/apk/debug/
./gradlew installDebug             # install on a connected device
```

### iOS
```bash
./gradlew :composeApp:linkDebugFrameworkIosSimulatorArm64   # Compose framework incl. the AVPlayer cinterop
```
A runnable SwiftUI host app lives in `iosApp/` (generated from
`project.yml` via `xcodegen`):
```bash
cd iosApp && xcodegen generate
xcodebuild -project ICSApp.xcodeproj -scheme ICSApp \
    -sdk iphonesimulator -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17' build
```

> **cinterop note.** Kotlin 2.3.x's cinterop parses the def's `sources =
> AVPlayerBridge.m` but does not compile the Obj-C implementation into the
> framework, so `_OBJC_CLASS_$_AVPlayerBridge` stays undefined at link time.
> The Gradle build works around this by compiling `AVPlayerBridge.m` to LLVM
> bitcode (`.bc`) and injecting it into the cinterop klib's `natives/`
> directory, where the Kotlin/Native linker picks it up. No manual steps
> needed — `linkDebugFrameworkIosSimulatorArm64` handles it end-to-end.

### Web (Wasm)
```bash
./gradlew wasmJsBrowserDevelopmentRun
```

To serve the production build from a static server:
```bash
./gradlew wasmJsBrowserDistribution
# serve composeApp/build/dist/wasmJs/productionExecutable/
```

## Tests & SDK discipline
```bash
./gradlew :mediakit:test                # the pure-Kotlin SDK core (JVM)
./gradlew :composeApp:testDebugUnitTest # Robolectric unit tests (resize matrix,
                                        # MemoryGovernor tiers, MainViewModel)
./gradlew :mediakit:apiCheck            # binary-compatibility validation
./gradlew :mediakit:dokkaHtml           # API docs → mediakit/build/dokka/html
./gradlew koverXmlReport                # coverage report
```

The `:mediakit` public API surface is tracked under `mediakit/api/` — accidental
binary-breaking changes fail CI. Dokka API docs are published to GitHub Pages on
`main`.

## Configuration

Transcription API keys (for Deepgram and Soniox) are read from `secrets.properties` in the project root. See `secrets.properties.example` for details.

## Manual Test Scenarios

If you are verifying feature parity or evaluating a PR, run through these core scenarios:

1. **Live Captions:** Enable CC from the player overlay and verify real-time text flows in seamlessly across platforms.
2. **ABR Ladder & Engine Playback:**
   - **ABR Synthesis:** The AI synthesized a ladder client-side from 4 sibling renditions. Use a network throttler to ensure the player gracefully auto-switches between 720p, 360p, 160p, and audio-only tiers. Check the debug stats overlay to confirm.
   - **Viewport-Aware ABR (FU-5):** Verify that playing on a small device doesn't over-download the 720p stream if 360p fits the physical display perfectly.
   - **Quality Menu:** Test manual override controls (Auto, 720p, 360p, 160p, Audio) to make sure they stick.
   - **Orientation & Layout:** Test a 9:16 vertical video. Ensure it pillarboxes correctly in portrait mode rather than cropping awkwardly. Verify that sensor-based rotate-to-fullscreen works for landscape videos.
3. **Scrubbing & Frame Previews:**
   - **Scrub Previews:** Drag the seekbar and confirm a floating thumbnail bubble appears. The `PreviewFrameEngine` relies on a secondary muted player hitting the `_160p` stream. Ensure ~2s granularity.
   - **Disk Caching (FU-2):** Scrub a video, force close the app completely, reopen, and scrub again. It should be instant because of the disk cache.
   - **Graceful Fallback:** Scrub rapidly. If frames aren't decoded fast enough, verify it falls back to a time-only bubble.
4. **Background, PiP, & Memory Governor (Mobile Only):**
   - **Background Audio:** Start playback, and put the app in the background (no PiP). Ensure playback shifts down to the audio-only tier (~51kbps) to save data, and continues with a `MediaSession` notification.
   - **Picture-in-Picture (PiP):** Enable PiP, minimize the app. Verify the PiP window shows with the correct aspect ratio (especially crucial for vertical videos) and player controls collapse properly.
   - **Memory Governor:** Simulate Android memory pressure (`adb shell am send-trim-memory <pid> TRIM_MEMORY_CRITICAL`). Ensure background resources like the `PreviewFrameEngine` and thumbnail LRU are immediately released and the player doesn't OOM.
5. **Live Event Verification:** Verify the jump-to-live button works, seeking is restricted to the DVR window, and that the UI seek slider doesn't infinitely "drift" forward.
6. **Offline Downloads:** Turn off all networking. Start the app and play a downloaded event to verify it properly resolves via the local cache.
