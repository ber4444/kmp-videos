# Plan: Media playback — thumbnail feed, full-screen player, playback SDK

## Goal
Build a production-quality media stack for this KMP app: a documented playback SDK on modern Android media frameworks (Media3/ExoPlayer), player-based UIs, and correct handling of horizontal and vertical video.

Concretely:
1. Replace the **Videos List dialog** with an **inline feed of video thumbnails** (poster frames, LIVE badges, durations). Tap a tile → **in-app full-screen player** with pause/seek/scrub-preview controls.
2. Extract the playback engine into a **`:mediakit` KMP library module** — a small playback SDK with a documented public API, consumed by the app.
3. Android = **ExoPlayer/Media3** (session service, PiP, downloads, memory governance). iOS = **AVPlayer** (later phase). Web (wasmJs) = hls.js (kept minimal).
4. Full **GitHub Actions CI** with unit + UI tests and coverage.

## Ground truth (measured against the live server, 2026-07-03)
These facts were verified with `curl` against `stream-host.example` and drive several design decisions:

- **Events are genuinely live at certain times of day** (next window: ~5 PM today) on the *same* URLs; outside those windows the URL serves the completed Wowza nDVR recording of the event.
- **The advertised master playlist carries exactly one 720p variant** — no ladder, no `EXT-X-I-FRAME-STREAM-INF`, no storyboard tracks. **But unadvertised renditions exist** at `live/event{i}{suffix}` (all measured):

  | suffix | resolution | bandwidth | codecs |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | *(none)* | 1280×720 | ~1.0 Mbps | avc1.42c01f + mp4a.40.2 |
  | `_360p` | 640×360 | ~507 kbps | avc1.4d401e + mp4a.40.2 |
  | `_160p` | 284×160 | ~262 kbps | avc1.42c015 + mp4a.40.2 |
  | `_aac` | audio-only | ~51 kbps | mp4a.40.2 |

- **Renditions are segment-aligned** (event14: 1675/1674/1674 × 2.0 s segments, total durations within one segment) — consistent with Wowza transcoding one source with aligned GOPs, so cross-rendition switching is viable.
- **Chunklist URLs rotate**: every `playlist.m3u8` request mints a fresh `chunklist_w<token>_DVR.m3u8` name (observed across consecutive fetches; older names kept resolving). Any client-built ladder must resolve chunklists **just-in-time** at playback start.
- **Chunklists are bounded after the event ends**: they end with `#EXT-X-ENDLIST` (event14 ≈ 56 min) → effectively VOD → downloadable. During a live window `ENDLIST` is absent → that *is* the "is live" signal.
- **Segment duration is 2 s** → keyframes at ≤ 2 s intervals → keyframe-accurate seeking has ~2 s granularity.
- **CORS is open** (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`) → hls.js on wasmJs works; the old plan's CORS risk is retired.
- **Missing events return a real 404** → the existing repository filter (skip 404s) is the correct "no placeholder tile" mechanism.

## Scrutiny of the proposed ideas (what changes and why)
Where the initial ideas needed correcting, and why:

1. **"YouTube requests the scrubbed timestamp from the server at low resolution"** — not literally how YouTube works: YouTube ships **pre-generated storyboard sprite sheets** (tiled JPEGs at several tiers) downloaded ahead of scrubbing. Our server has no storyboard and no I-frame playlist, so the equivalent is **client-side keyframe extraction from the `_160p` rendition**: a second, muted, video-only ExoPlayer on `event{i}_160p` with `SeekParameters.CLOSEST_SYNC`, debounced scrub requests (~200 ms), rendering into a small preview surface, with an LRU bitmap cache. Cost per unique scrub stop ≈ one 2 s segment at ~262 kbps ≈ **65 KB**, decode cost trivial at 284×160. Precision ≈ keyframe interval (~2 s) — visually equivalent to YouTube's storyboard granularity. Net: the *mechanism* differs from the idea as stated, but the outcome (low-res frame fetched from the server for the scrubbed timestamp) is exactly what ships.
2. **"Fetch 144p/240p frames for thumbnails"** — confirmed feasible: the server exposes unadvertised `_160p` (284×160) and `_360p` renditions (measured). Tile posters and scrub previews fetch from `event{i}_160p` — the 144p-class source the idea asked for, already tile-sized. The preview player also sets `forceLowestBitrate(true)` so behavior is identical on any stream with an advertised ladder.
3. **ABR** — ExoPlayer does ABR automatically (`AdaptiveTrackSelection` + bandwidth meter) *when the master playlist advertises a ladder* — this server's masters advertise only one variant, so out of the box ABR is a no-op here. But the renditions exist, so we **synthesize the multivariant playlist client-side**: probe the four rendition playlists, resolve their chunklist URLs just-in-time (they rotate — see Ground truth), emit a spec-correct master with measured `BANDWIDTH`/`RESOLUTION`/`CODECS` attributes and absolute chunklist URIs, include `_aac` as the audio-only bottom tier (per Apple's ladder guidance), and hand it to `HlsMediaSource` via a `data:` URI (`DataSchemeDataSource`). Result: **genuine ABR on the production streams** plus a quality menu backed by real renditions. Fallback if chunklist rotation or GOP alignment bites: manual quality switching across rendition URLs with position-preserving reload.
4. **"Frame recycling / reuse video frame buffers"** — decoded frame buffers are owned and recycled by **MediaCodec** internally; this is not an app-level knob. The real, equivalent engineering: **one shared extractor/preview player** instead of N per-tile players (this supersedes the old plan's 3-player cap design), surface reuse, and a pooled/LRU bitmap cache for thumbnails.
5. **Live Caption** — a system feature the user toggles; apps cannot invoke it programmatically. Our obligations: correct `AudioAttributes` (`USAGE_MEDIA` — already set) and not blocking capture (`setAllowedCapturePolicy`), plus a README note. Actual in-app transcription = PCM tap via `TeeAudioProcessor` feeding an on-device recognizer (Vosk) — kept as a stretch phase because it's large (model asset, resampling, threading).
6. **"Pre-download with WorkManager"** — WorkManager alone cannot download HLS (hundreds of segments, resume, cache indexing). The correct Media3 architecture: **`DownloadService` + `HlsDownloader`**, with **`WorkManagerScheduler`** (`media3-exoplayer-workmanager`) so unmet-requirement restarts go through WorkManager, and `Requirements(NETWORK_UNMETERED)` for wifi-only. Backgrounding doesn't interrupt because `DownloadService` is a foreground service; WorkManager resumes it after process death. Measured reality: today's events are bounded (`ENDLIST`) → downloadable. Unbounded (truly live) events get a **LIVE badge** and no download affordance.
7. **404 handling** — already correct in `VideoRepository` (404s never enter the list). We extend it: probe in parallel, and if a stream 404s *after* listing (e.g. removed between probe and render), the tile's thumbnail load failure removes the tile rather than showing a placeholder.
8. **iOS/AVPlayer** — sound idea, own phase. Expert caveat: `AVAssetImageGenerator` does **not** work on HTTP Live Streams; iOS scrub previews use `AVPlayerItemVideoOutput`. iOS offline uses `AVAssetDownloadURLSession` (WorkManager is Android-only).
9. **"Pause video, continue audio in background"** — subtle trap: with muxed HLS (video+audio in the same TS segments), disabling the video renderer stops *decode* but **not download** — the muxed segments keep streaming at full bitrate. With the synthesized ladder including the `_aac` audio-only tier, backgrounding constrains track selection to that tier → real savings (~51 kbps vs ~1 Mbps) while the `MediaSession` keeps audio going. Verify ExoPlayer drops to the audio-only variant when video is disabled; fallback: swap the `MediaItem` to the `_aac` URL with a position handoff. Re-enable video on foreground. PiP is preferred when the user is actively watching and the device supports it.

## Architecture
```
:composeApp        — app UI (feed, login, screens), navigation, DI wiring
:mediakit          — KMP playback SDK
  commonMain       — PlayerController (expect/actual facade), PlayerState (StateFlow),
                     EventCatalog (probe/parse), PlaylistInspector (pure-Kotlin HLS tag
                     parser: variants, ENDLIST/live, duration), LadderSynthesizer
                     (multivariant playlist builder over the probed renditions),
                     ThumbnailProvider API, DownloadState model, MediaKitConfig
  androidMain      — ExoPlayerController, PreviewFrameEngine (shared extractor player),
                     PlaybackService (MediaSessionService), DownloadCenter
                     (DownloadService + WorkManagerScheduler + CacheDataSource),
                     MemoryGovernor (LoadControl + onTrimMemory tiers)
  iosMain (P7)     — AVPlayerController, AVPlayerItemVideoOutput previews, PiP
  wasmJsMain       — thin hls.js binding
```
SDK discipline: `explicitApi()`, Dokka, `binary-compatibility-validator`, semantic version in the module, README with API examples. `PlaylistInspector` is deliberately pure Kotlin (no I/O) so it's unit-testable in `commonTest`.

---

## Phase 0 — Cleanup: remove audio-only, simplify navigation *(carried over from the previous plan; still valid)*
- **`commonMain/App.kt`**: delete the Audio-only `Row`/`Switch`, the Live Events `Button`, `onShowVideosDialog`/`onDismissVideosDialog`, the `VideosDialog` composable and its `if (uiState.isVideosDialogVisible)` block. Relabel the password `TextField` → **"Login to events"** (keep styling). Route becomes `player/{eventNumber}` — drop `PlayerAudioOnlyArg`, its `navArgument`, and the `audioOnly` decode.
- **`commonMain/MainViewModel.kt`**: remove dialog state + methods; remove `audioOnly` from `MainUiState`/`PlaybackRequest` (fold `PlaybackRequest` into the nav call); expose `ensureVideosLoaded()`.
- **`commonMain/Platform.kt`**: `getUrl(eventNumber)` single-arg (no `_aac` branch); `PlatformPlayerScreen(url, onClose)`.
- **`androidMain/Platform.android.kt`**: delete the `audioOnly` branch (the `Column` control-panel layout), `buildPlaybackMediaSource`'s merge path — `FilteringMediaSource`, `MergingMediaSource`, `deriveAudioOnlyUrl` all go. `audioAttributes` fixed to `AUDIO_CONTENT_TYPE_MOVIE`.
- **`wasmJsMain/Platform.wasmJs.kt`**: drop the `audioOnly` param + copy branch.
- Rationale: the stream already muxes AAC (`CODECS="avc1.42c01f,mp4a.40.2"`, verified), so the login-screen toggle and the dual-stream `MergingMediaSource` plumbing are dead weight. The `_aac` stream itself is *not* dead: it returns in Phase 3 as the synthesized ladder's audio-only tier — reached via track selection, never via URL merging.

## Phase 1 — `:mediakit` module + data layer + CI skeleton
- Create `:mediakit` KMP module; move player/URL/probe code behind its API. `getUrl` becomes `MediaKitConfig`-driven with rendition support — `renditionUrl(eventNumber, tier)` where tier ∈ {P720, P360, P160, AUDIO} maps to the `""`/`_360p`/`_160p`/`_aac` suffixes (base URL injectable → testable, and the hardcoded server stops being sprinkled through app code).
- **`PlaylistInspector`** (commonMain, pure functions): parse master → variant list (resolution/bandwidth/codecs, chunklist URI); parse chunklist → `isLive` (no `ENDLIST`), `durationMs` (Σ `EXTINF`), target duration.
- **`LadderSynthesizer`** (commonMain): pure function `(List<ProbedRendition>) -> String` emitting the multivariant playlist text (unit-testable with golden files), plus a suspend resolver that probes the rendition playlists in parallel and extracts fresh chunklist URLs (JIT, because they rotate). Renditions that 404 are simply omitted from the ladder — per-event rendition availability is not assumed.
- **`EventCatalog`** replaces `VideoRepository`'s sequential loop: probe events **in parallel** (bounded concurrency ~5, Ktor), returning `EventInfo(eventNumber, isLive, durationMs)` — 404s excluded (unchanged behavior, satisfies "no placeholder for 404"). Only the base rendition is probed for existence; the full ladder is resolved lazily at playback/preview time. Cache with a TTL; keep retry.
- **CI skeleton** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): `compileDebugKotlinAndroid` + `compileKotlinWasmJs`, `:mediakit:allTests` (commonTest: inspector, catalog with Ktor `MockEngine`, ViewModel with `kotlinx-coroutines-test`), ktlint or detekt, Kover coverage upload. CI grows with each later phase.

## Phase 2 — Thumbnail feed (replaces the dialog)
- **`LiveEventsGallery`** (commonMain): logged-in state of `LoginScreen` swaps the field for a feed — `LazyRow` (or 2-row grid if >8 events) of 16:9 tiles: poster thumbnail, title, **LIVE badge** (`isLive`) or duration label, loading/error/empty states. `expect LiveEventTile(...)` stays the per-platform seam.
- **Android `ThumbnailProvider`**: one shared **`PreviewFrameEngine`** — a single muted, video-only ExoPlayer (or `ExperimentalFrameExtractor` from `media3-transformer`; evaluate first, fall back to the DIY player+`ImageReader` if its HLS support or API stability disappoints) **pointed at the `_160p` rendition** — 284×160 is already tile-sized and a frame costs ~65 KB of network. Sequentially: load `event{i}_160p` → seek 10% in (`CLOSEST_SYNC`) → capture frame → **memory LRU + disk cache** keyed by event+position. Tiles render cached bitmaps; failures (late 404) remove the tile; if `_160p` is missing for an event, fall back to `_360p`, then base.
- Optional polish: the tile nearest the viewport center autoplays a muted preview using the same single engine (YouTube-feed pattern, still exactly one decoder). **This supersedes the old plan's N-mini-players-with-cap-3 design** — one decoder instead of three, and tiles are cheap bitmaps.
- **wasmJs tile**: keep the old plan's hover-to-play `<video>` overlay (create on hover-enter, destroy on exit, ≤1 active stream; bounds via `onGloballyPositioned`, hls.js from `index.html` with feature-detect). CORS verified open, so this now works in Chrome/Firefox, not just Safari.
- ViewModel: `MainUiState.availableVideos: List<EventInfo>`; `ensureVideosLoaded()` on login.

## Phase 3 — Full-screen player upgrades (Android)
The existing player (aspect-ratio-aware `PlayerSurface`, scrub slider, jump-to-live) is the base. Add:
- **Controls UX**: auto-hide after 3 s of inactivity (currently tap-toggle only), buffering spinner (`Player.STATE_BUFFERING`), error surface with retry (currently log-only `onPlayerError`), immersive mode (hide system bars).
- **Horizontal & vertical video**:
  - Layout matrix already compares content AR vs container AR — extend with **resize modes** (fit default; fill/zoom toggle) and a **portrait-content path**: 9:16 content in portrait fills height with pillarboxing rules; landscape content offers rotate-to-fullscreen (sensor-based, plus manual button).
  - Verified via `SimpleBasePlayer` fakes reporting portrait `videoSize` in UI tests + vertical demo source.
- **Scrub preview thumbnails** (the YouTube-style feature, per Scrutiny #1): while dragging, a floating preview above the seekbar; `PreviewFrameEngine` seeks the debounced target on the `_160p` stream (`CLOSEST_SYNC`), LRU-cached frames make repeat scrubs instant. Falls back gracefully (time-only bubble) when frames aren't ready.
- **Real ABR via ladder synthesis** (Scrutiny #3): the player's `MediaItem` is built from `LadderSynthesizer`'s multivariant playlist (`data:` URI → `HlsMediaSource`), so `AdaptiveTrackSelection` + `DefaultBandwidthMeter` adapt across 720p/360p/160p/audio-only on the production streams. `DefaultTrackSelector` gets `setViewportSizeToPhysicalDisplaySize`; **quality menu** = Auto + the real renditions via `TrackSelectionParameters`; debug stats overlay shows current rendition/bitrate/buffer (the adaptation is *visible*, not just claimed).
- **Demo-sources debug menu** (debug builds only): Apple's multivariant bipbop stream (server-advertised ladder + I-frame playlists), a vertical HLS/MP4 sample, and the production events — proves the player is not hardwired to one server's conventions, and covers vertical-video and trick-play cases this server lacks.

## Phase 4 — Lifecycle, background, PiP, memory
- **`PlaybackService`**: media3 `MediaSessionService` + `MediaSession` (artifact `media3-session`); notification with artwork (event thumbnail); `foregroundServiceType="mediaPlayback"` + `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PLAYBACK` permission (API 34+); audio focus + becoming-noisy already handled, keep.
- **Backgrounding policy** (per Scrutiny #9): app to background while playing → if PiP available and user opted in → PiP; else continue audio constrained to the ladder's audio-only tier (~51 kbps — disabling the video renderer alone would keep downloading muxed segments at full rate); on return, restore video selection. Player ownership moves from the composable into the service/controller so process/config changes don't kill playback.
- **PiP**: `supportsPictureInPicture` + `configChanges` in the manifest; `PictureInPictureParams` with aspect ratio from `videoSize` (clamped to platform 1:2.39–2.39:1 — matters for vertical video), `setAutoEnterEnabled` (API 31+) + `setSourceRectHint`; controls collapse in PiP.
- **MemoryGovernor**:
  - **Adaptive `LoadControl`**: `DefaultLoadControl.Builder` tuned by `ActivityManager.isLowRamDevice()`/`getMemoryInfo` — e.g. low-RAM: `setBufferDurationsMs(10_000, 30_000, 1_500, 3_000)` + `setTargetBufferBytes` cap; defaults otherwise. Numbers are tunables, documented as such.
  - **`onTrimMemory` tiers**: MODERATE → shrink thumbnail LRU; LOW → also release `PreviewFrameEngine` + cap `setMaxVideoSize` (no-op on this server, correct on ABR streams); CRITICAL → keep only the foreground player.
  - This trio (adaptive buffers, trim tiers, shared extractor) is the honest implementation of memory ideas #6–8 from the Scrutiny list.

## Phase 5 — Offline downloads
- **`DownloadCenter`**: `DownloadService` + `DownloadManager` + `HlsDownloader` (via `DownloadHelper`), `SimpleCache` + `CacheDataSource` shared between download and playback; `WorkManagerScheduler` (`media3-exoplayer-workmanager`) for requirement-based restarts; `Requirements(NETWORK_UNMETERED)` = wifi-only.
- **Eligibility**: `EventInfo.isLive == false` (bounded playlist) → downloadable; live → LIVE badge, no download UI (per Scrutiny #6; outside live windows all events are bounded, so the feature is fully demoable).
- **Download quality**: downloads target a concrete rendition URL (default `_360p` ≈ 220 MB/h vs ~450 MB/h at 720p; user-selectable) rather than the synthesized `data:`-URI ladder — keeps `DownloadManager` cache keys stable and sidesteps chunklist rotation for stored content.
- Feed tiles get download state (progress ring / downloaded check / remove); player prefers cache automatically via `CacheDataSource`; airplane-mode playback is the acceptance test.
- Auto pre-download of new events on wifi as an opt-in setting (`DownloadManager.addDownload` on catalog refresh).

## Phase 6 — Tests, CI hardening, docs polish
Tests are written *per phase*; this phase completes the harness:
- **commonTest**: `PlaylistInspector` (variant parsing, ENDLIST/live detection, duration math), `LadderSynthesizer` (golden-file playlist output, missing-rendition omission, attribute correctness), `EventCatalog` (MockEngine: 404 exclusion, parallel probe, error paths), `MainViewModel` state transitions.
- **Android unit (Robolectric)**: `ExoPlayerController` with `media3-test-utils(-robolectric)` (`TestPlayerRunHelper`, `FakeClock`); MemoryGovernor tier logic; DownloadCenter state mapping.
- **Compose UI tests**: feed states (loading/error/empty/populated, LIVE badge), player controls (auto-hide, seek callbacks, quality menu) against **`SimpleBasePlayer`** fakes — including a portrait `videoSize` fake for the vertical-video layout assertions; screenshot tests via Roborazzi (optional but cheap once fakes exist).
- **CI**: jobs for build (android debug + wasm), unit tests + Kover gate, instrumented tests via `reactivecircus/android-emulator-runner` (KVM on ubuntu runners), Dokka docs published to GH Pages, APK artifact upload. Badges in README.
- **README as front door**: architecture diagram, GIFs (feed → player → scrub preview → PiP → offline), the Scrutiny section's engineering-judgment notes distilled, API docs link.
- Minor hardening: move the login gate password out of source (gradle property / `local.properties`).

## Phase 7 — iOS target (AVPlayer)
- Add `iosArm64`/`iosSimulatorArm64` + CMP iOS app entry; `AVPlayerController: PlayerController` in `iosMain`.
- Playback: `AVPlayer` + `AVPlayerLayer` in `UIKitView` (HLS + ABR are native); controls reuse the shared Compose UI driven by `PlayerState`.
- Scrub preview: `AVPlayerItemVideoOutput` frame grabs (**not** `AVAssetImageGenerator` — doesn't support HLS).
- Background audio: `AVAudioSession(.playback)` + `UIBackgroundModes: audio`; PiP: `AVPictureInPictureController`.
- Scope: playback + PiP + background audio = parity core. iOS offline (`AVAssetDownloadURLSession`) and transcription are explicitly out of scope for v1 of this phase. CI: macos runner compiles `iosSimulatorArm64` + runs common tests.

## Phase 8 — Stretch: transcription
- **Live Caption**: no code — verify `USAGE_MEDIA` (done) and default capture policy; README note on enabling it (per Scrutiny #5).
- **In-app on-device transcription**: custom `RenderersFactory` → `DefaultAudioSink` with `TeeAudioProcessor` tapping PCM → resample → **Vosk** small-model recognizer on a background thread → `StateFlow<List<CaptionCue>>` → Compose caption overlay with a CC toggle. Ship the model as a downloadable asset, not in the APK (~50 MB). Also enable Media3's built-in text renderer so CEA-608/708 would render if a stream ever carries them.

## Key technical decisions
- **One shared frame engine** for tiles + scrub previews (supersedes per-tile players): bounded decode/network cost, and it *is* the legitimate version of "frame recycling".
- **Client-side keyframe previews from the `_160p` rendition** instead of pretending the server has storyboards; debounce + LRU keeps cost ≈ 65 KB per unique scrub stop.
- **Client-side ladder synthesis** turns four unadvertised sibling renditions into a real ABR ladder (with an audio-only bottom tier that doubles as the background-audio path) — the single highest-leverage media decision in the plan.
- **Playback engine lives in `:mediakit`, owned by a service**, not by a composable — survives config changes and enables background audio/PiP.
- **Live vs VOD decided by playlist inspection** (`ENDLIST`), driving both the LIVE badge and download eligibility.
- **wasmJs stays thin** (hover preview + in-page player); the effort is Android-first, iOS second.

## Risks & open questions
- `ExperimentalFrameExtractor` is `@UnstableApi` and may not love live-edge HLS → fallback DIY extractor is specced above; decide in Phase 2 with a spike.
- **Ladder synthesis fragilities**: chunklist `w`-token rotation (mitigated by JIT resolution at playback start; verify old chunklist URLs survive a full long session — if Wowza expires them mid-playback, fall back to manual rendition switching) and assumed GOP alignment across renditions (segment counts/durations match, but verify switches are glitch-free on device; misalignment → same fallback).
- The live path (no `ENDLIST`, sliding DVR window, `isCurrentMediaItemLive`, jump-to-live) must be re-verified during a real live window — one airs ~5 PM today, use it.
- Rendition availability per event is assumed uniform but unverified across all events — `LadderSynthesizer` omits 404ing renditions, so worst case an event degrades to fewer tiers.
- CMP-on-iOS `UIKitView` z-ordering with overlaid Compose controls needs a spike (known CMP interop sharp edge).
- Vosk model size/licensing and PCM resampling effort make Phase 8 genuinely optional.

## Verification
- Per phase: `./gradlew :composeApp:compileDebugKotlinAndroid :composeApp:compileKotlinWasmJs :mediakit:allTests` green locally and in CI.
- Phase 2: login → feed shows only existing events (kill one URL → no tile, no placeholder); thumbnails appear without jank; scroll is 60 fps.
- Phase 3: scrub → preview bubble tracks the thumb with ~2 s granularity; stats overlay shows rendition switching on the production ladder under network throttling (`adb shell cmd netpolicy` / emulator network profiles); quality menu switches renditions on both production and bipbop streams; vertical sample fills portrait correctly.
- Phase 4: background during playback → audio continues (notification) at the audio-only tier (verify bandwidth drop in the stats overlay) or PiP; return → video resumes; `adb shell am send-trim-memory` exercises governor tiers.
- **Live window (e.g. today ~5 PM)**: feed shows the LIVE badge on the airing event, player follows the live edge, jump-to-live works, seek stays within the DVR window, download UI is absent for it.
- Phase 5: download on wifi, enable airplane mode → playback works; LIVE-badged items expose no download UI.
- Phase 6: CI green end-to-end, coverage badge live, Dokka published.

## Follow-up PRs (deferred items, tracked so they aren't forgotten)

These were deferred during Phases 0–6 (each called out in its PR's "Scope notes")
and form their own coherent follow-up PRs after Phase 6 lands. They are *not*
required for the core feature set — they deepen it.

- **FU-1: Scrub preview thumbnails.** While dragging the seekbar, a floating
  preview bubble; `PreviewFrameEngine` seeks the debounced target (~200 ms) on
  the `_160p` rendition (`CLOSEST_SYNC`), LRU-cached frames make repeat scrubs
  instant. Falls back to a time-only bubble when frames aren't ready. Needs the
  `PreviewFrameEngine` hoisted so the player screen and the feed share one
  instance (it currently lives in `MainActivity`'s composition; the player is
  service-owned, so this requires a lookup/`expect` seam to reach the engine
  from the service-driven controller path). See Scrutiny #1.

- **FU-2: `PreviewFrameEngine` disk cache.** Today the engine has an in-memory
  LRU only; the plan called for "memory LRU + disk cache" keyed by event +
  position. A `DiskLruCache` / media3 `SimpleCache`-backed frame store survives
  process death and avoids re-decoding on relaunch. Modest subsystem.

- **FU-3: `EventCatalog` TTL cache + retry.** Today the catalog re-probes every
  entry on each `loadEvents()` call. Add a bounded TTL cache (the plan's
  Phase 1) so repeated gallery opens don't re-hit the server, plus retry with
  backoff on probe failure. Resilience/efficiency polish.

- **FU-4: Demo-sources debug menu + rotate-to-fullscreen.** Debug-build menu
  with Apple's multivariant bipbop stream (server-advertised ladder + I-frame
  playlists — proves the player isn't hardwired to one server), a vertical
  HLS/MP4 sample, and the production events; plus sensor-based
  rotate-to-fullscreen for landscape content and a manual button. Demo polish
  that covers vertical-video and trick-play cases this server lacks.

- **FU-5: Viewport-aware ABR.** Enable
  `DefaultTrackSelector` viewport-size-from-physical-display so the player picks
  the rendition that fits the screen rather than decoding a higher one it can't
  show. A no-op on the single-720p advertised master but correct on the
  synthesized ladder and demo streams; needs the exact media3 1.10 extension
  resolved (the convenience extension's call site moved across versions).

## Standalone PR plan — Gradle 9 and AGP 9 migration

### Goal

Upgrade the project to Android Gradle Plugin 9.2.1 and Gradle 9.6.1 using the
supported Kotlin Multiplatform integration. The PR must leave application
behavior unchanged, keep iOS and Wasm in `:composeApp`, and make every
Gradle-dependent CI job pass.

This plan follows Google's **Upgrade to AGP 9** skill and, because that skill
explicitly excludes KMP projects, the JetBrains
**KMP AGP 9.0 Migration** companion skill it recommends.

### Why the module split is mandatory

AGP 9's new DSL and built-in Kotlin no longer support applying
`com.android.application` or `com.android.library` beside
`org.jetbrains.kotlin.multiplatform` in the same Gradle subproject.

The current modules therefore map to these migration paths:

| Current module | Current plugins | Required AGP 9 shape |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `:composeApp` | KMP + Android application | KMP Android library plus a new pure Android `:androidApp` |
| `:mediakit` | KMP + Android library | KMP Android library |

The minimum supported structure is:

```text
:androidApp   — pure Android application, launcher and packaging
:composeApp   — shared KMP UI plus Android, iOS, and Wasm implementations
:mediakit     — shared KMP playback SDK
```

Renaming `:composeApp` to `:shared` or extracting a separate `:webApp` is not
required for AGP 9 and is deliberately deferred.

### Version scope

Update only tooling required by the migration:

- Android Gradle Plugin: `9.2.1`
- Gradle wrapper: `9.6.1`, including regenerated wrapper JAR and launch scripts
- Add `com.android.kotlin.multiplatform.library` at the AGP version
- Keep Kotlin at `2.3.20` unless configuration or compilation proves a newer
  version is required
- Keep Compose Multiplatform at `1.10.3`; it is above the AGP 9-compatible
  minimum
- Upgrade Dokka to `2.2.0` because the current `1.9.20` is not AGP 9-compatible
- Upgrade another build plugin only if a failing migration check identifies it
  as incompatible
- Do not include ordinary AndroidX, Media3, Ktor, coroutines, Metro, Vosk, or
  other runtime-library updates from Dependabot PR #33

Keep the version catalog and `settings.gradle.kts` plugin declarations
consistent. Remove unused `com.android.library` and
`org.jetbrains.kotlin.android` aliases/declarations once no module applies
them.

### 1. Create the pure Android application module

Add `:androidApp` and apply:

- `com.android.application`
- `org.jetbrains.kotlin.plugin.compose`

Do not apply `org.jetbrains.kotlin.android`; AGP 9 supplies built-in Kotlin.

Move Android application ownership from `:composeApp` to `:androidApp`:

- `applicationId`, `targetSdk`, version code, and version name
- launcher manifest and app/service declarations
- launcher icons, theme, and other app-level Android resources
- `proguard-rules.pro` and release build type
- login password and vertical-demo `BuildConfig` fields
- `MainActivity`

Use a namespace distinct from both KMP libraries. Keep the shipping
`applicationId` unchanged.

The module depends on `:composeApp`, Android Activity Compose, and Android
debug tooling. It should contain no business logic or duplicated shared UI.

### 2. Add a narrow Android host bridge

After the split, shared Android code cannot reference `:androidApp`'s generated
`BuildConfig` or `MainActivity` because the dependency direction is
`:androidApp` → `:composeApp`.

Add a small public Android host API in `:composeApp` that:

- accepts immutable app configuration values from `:androidApp`
  (`eventsPassword`, `verticalDemoUrl`, and `isDebug`)
- hosts the existing shared `App()` composition
- owns or exposes the existing shared preview-frame memory-trim hook without
  leaking implementation classes into the app module
- exposes PiP state and the existing `PipController` seam without shared code
  naming `MainActivity`

`MainActivity` passes its `BuildConfig` values into this host API and reports
PiP lifecycle changes through it. Replace all shared references to
`BuildConfig.*` and `MainActivity.InPipState` with the injected configuration
and host state.

This bridge is the only planned production-code refactor. Playback, navigation,
networking, UI behavior, and media policy remain unchanged.

### 3. Convert `:composeApp` to the KMP Android library plugin

Replace `com.android.application` with
`com.android.kotlin.multiplatform.library`.

Inside `kotlin { android { ... } }`:

- set a library namespace distinct from `:androidApp`
- retain `compileSdk = 36` and `minSdk = 23`
- set Android compiler options to JVM 17
- enable Android resources explicitly
- enable host tests with Android resources

Remove application-only DSL: `applicationId`, `targetSdk`, version fields,
build types, ProGuard configuration, and app `BuildConfig` fields.

Migrate `androidUnitTest` to the AGP 9 `androidHostTest` source set and move its
directory if required by the plugin. Replace deprecated delegated source-set
lookup and Compose dependency shortcuts with version-catalog dependencies.
Replace `debugImplementation` tooling with the KMP Android runtime classpath
configuration.

Keep iOS framework configuration, Wasm configuration, shared Compose resources,
and all non-launcher Android implementations in `:composeApp`.

### 4. Convert `:mediakit` to the KMP Android library plugin

Replace `com.android.library` with
`com.android.kotlin.multiplatform.library`.

Move the standalone Android configuration into `kotlin { android { ... } }`:

- namespace
- `compileSdk = 36`
- `minSdk = 23`
- JVM 17 compiler options

Retain explicit API mode, JVM, Wasm, iOS targets, source-set dependencies, API
validation, Dokka, and Kover. Enable Android resources or Java only if the
module's sources actually require them.

### 5. Migrate Gradle and AGP DSL usage

- Replace the removed task-action `Project.exec { commandLine(...) }` call used
  by the AVPlayer bridge with a Gradle 9-compatible public execution API
- Use only public AGP 9 DSL interfaces; do not use AGP internals or the legacy
  variant API
- Preserve the custom `BuildConfig` string quoting at the Android application
  boundary
- Regenerate the Gradle wrapper rather than hand-editing its binary or scripts
- Update CI task paths from `:composeApp` to `:androidApp` only where the task
  is an Android application packaging/build task

### 6. Adopt AGP 9 defaults deliberately

Remove the migration opt-outs after the module conversion:

- `android.builtInKotlin=false`
- `android.newDsl=false`
- `android.uniquePackageNames=false`
- `android.enableAppCompileTimeRClass=false`

Also remove global compatibility properties whose AGP 9 defaults are safe for
this project after verification, including global `resValues` enablement and
defaults already specified explicitly in module DSL.

Do not add `android.disallowKotlinSourceSets=false`. Do not retain a temporary
legacy-DSL or built-in-Kotlin opt-out as the final migration state.

### 7. Verification order

Do not run `clean`.

1. Confirm JDK 17 and the Android SDK/build tools required by AGP 9 are
   available.
2. Run `./gradlew help`.
3. Run `./gradlew build --dry-run`.
4. Run the unit-test, Kover, and binary-API checks used by CI.
5. Build the Android debug application from `:androidApp`.
6. Build the Wasm production distribution from `:composeApp`.
7. Generate Dokka documentation.
8. Compile the iOS simulator framework on macOS to verify the AVPlayer bridge
   task and framework packaging.
9. Confirm the launcher manifest, services, resources, `BuildConfig` values,
   PiP state, and debug-only demo menu still behave on an Android emulator.
10. Verify every GitHub Actions check passes on the standalone PR.

Gradle IDE sync must succeed before the migration is considered complete. If
an automated IDE-sync check is unavailable, record successful command-line
configuration plus a manual Android Studio sync as the final acceptance step.

### Success criteria

- No module combines a classic Android application/library plugin with KMP
- `:androidApp` is the only Android application module
- `:composeApp` and `:mediakit` use the KMP Android library plugin
- Built-in Kotlin and the new AGP DSL are enabled without legacy opt-outs
- Shipping application ID, version, launcher, services, resources, and runtime
  behavior are unchanged
- Android, Wasm, iOS, tests, API validation, coverage, and docs all configure
  and build successfully
- The PR contains no unrelated runtime dependency upgrades or feature changes

### Rollback and review strategy

Keep the migration in one standalone PR because the module split, plugin
replacement, and AGP/Gradle version changes cannot independently leave a
buildable project. Organize commits by review boundary:

1. module split and host bridge
2. KMP Android plugin/DSL conversion
3. Gradle wrapper and build-plugin versions
4. CI task-path and documentation updates

If a required third-party build plugin is incompatible with the new DSL and has
no supported version, stop rather than merging with legacy opt-out flags. Record
the blocking plugin and minimum required upgrade in the PR.
